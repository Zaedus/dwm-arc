# DWM Arc

This is my configuration of [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) with a bunch of patches enabled.

## General Info

An autostart script should be placed at `~/.dwm/autostart.sh`

Not a whole lot of information is going to be on here, so go to the [main repo](https://github.com/Zaedus/arc-dotfiles) for more info.
